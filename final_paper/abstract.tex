The focus of this project was to evaluate various machine learning techniques in developing useful models for determining risk. Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending application where users can request loans for various purposes and other users can fund these loans at a given rate and grade. This data is rich and noisy providing ample attributes to run against different loss methodologies. Our results indicate that logistic regression and neural nets perform fairly well against this particular dataset, while random forests overfit quickly and perceptron seemed too restrictive, indicating rigid linear models may not be ideal predictors. The trained models scored higher sensitivities, and performed reasonably well for other metrics.
