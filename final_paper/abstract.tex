The focus of this project was to evaluate various machine learning techniques in developing useful models for evaluating the importance of various attributes for loans in determining risk. 
Lending Club is a peer-to-peer lending application where users can request loans for various purposes and other users can fund these loans at a given rate and grade. This data is rich and noisy providing ample data to run against different loss methodologies. Our results indicate that logistic regression and neural nets perform fairly well against this particular dataset, while perceptrons overfit and test poorly and random forests overfit. The trained models scored high sensitivities, and performed reasonably well for other metrics.
