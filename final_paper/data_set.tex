\subsection{Data Set}

The dataset is provided by Lending Club on an ongoing basis for all the loans granted and denied on their application going as far back as 2007. The data is a set of all loans issued in the time period and their current status \cite{lendingclub}. Included are 145 columns relating to attributes of the loan itself, credit statistics, and Lending Club assigned variables  

\subsubsection{Data Cleaning}

Columns with text values were removed. Columns related to the loan status were also removed.  Every column less than half full were removed and rows with empty values were either filled with mean data or removed entirely depending on their likely effect on outcome.  

\subsubsection{Transform}

Categorical variables were replaced with their one-hot coded columns.  Zip and state columns were removed simply for their size when encoded. All other numerical variables were encoding around their unit norm.
