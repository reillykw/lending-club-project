\subsection{Perceptron}
Perceptrons easily overfit

\subsubsection{Logistic Regression}
Logistic Regression was surprisingly powerful, not surprising


\subsubsection{Random Forests}
Easily Overfit, may need to tweek params

\subsubsection{Neural Net}

Not much variance or improvements with deeper models, best to keep it simple
